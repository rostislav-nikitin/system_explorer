# Contributing to wxCharts

## alpha Branch

Contributions should be made to the alpha branch. The reason for this is that the project is
still undergoing quite a lot of changes and we have limited time to review and integrate all
the contributions. Pull requests to the alpha branch are merged faster so you can use the 
alpha branch if you need the latest features. However incompatible code changes happen more
frequently in the alpha branch.

## Instructions

1. Fork wxCharts in your own account
2. Make your changes in your fork
5. Submit a pull request to the wxIshiko/wxCharts alpha branch

## Coding Standards

wxCharts tries to comply with the coding conventions of the main
wxWidgets project. Contributions should broadly follow these 
conventions too.
