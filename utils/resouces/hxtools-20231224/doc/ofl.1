.SH Differences to lsof/fuser
.IP \(bu 4
`lsof /home/user` and `fuser /home/user` would not list processes that have a
descriptor open on /home/user/subdir.
.IP \(bu 4
`fuser -m /home/subdir` would automatically go down to the root of a vfsmount
(e.g. /home) and list all processes, instead of limiting to /home/subdir.
