.SH Name
xcp \(em proof-of-concept cp(1) with alternate copying mechanisms
.SH Syntax
\fBxcp\fP [\fB\-d\fP] [\fB\-m\fP|\fB\-\-mmap\fP] [\fB\-s\fP|\fB\-\-splice\fP]
\fIfromfile\fP \fItofile\fP
.SH Description
Copies the file from \fIsrc\fP to \fIdst\fP using \fBmmap\fP(2) or
\fBsplice\fP(2) instead of the \fBread\fP(2)-\fBwrite\fP(2) cycle that is
normally used. mmap may actually be faster than the r/w cycle.
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Calls mmap(2) on both the source and destination, and does a memcpy(3).
.TP
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-mmap\fP
Calls mmap(2) on the source and uses write(2) for the destination.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-splice\fP
Calls splice(2) on a pipe(2) pair. This is silly, but it is what it is because
splice(2) does not support file-to-file transfers.
