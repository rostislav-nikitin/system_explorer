== VC FONTS ==

The .fnt files are to be used for the virtual console (vc, also known as
/dev/tty1 ... tty63). These raw font files come without an explicit
Unicode map, and are commonly using a cp437 mapping. Use

	setfont xxx.fnt -u /usr/share/kbd/unimaps/cp437.uni

to load it.


== SUSE users ==

You can edit /etc/sysconfig/console and set CONSOLE_FONT to the desired
font and CONSOLE_UNICODEMAP to /usr/share/kbd/unimaps/cp437.uni.


== KEYBOARD MAPS ==

The .map files are (additional!) keyboard maps. They build up upon
certain keyboard definitions from the "kbd" package and make some more
keys available. If you want to load one at boot-up in openSUSE, use
KEYTABLE in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.

== FONT OVERVIEW ==

Unless otherwise noted,
 - the font glyph cells are 8 pixels wide and 16 pixels high
 - the actual font glyphs may use all of these 8 pixels
 - the fonts were designed for a 9 pixel wide character cell
   (IBM-style text mode, where the 9th column is a clone of
   the 8th for positions 0xB0-0xDF, and otherwise blank)

Linux fbdev makes the character cells as big as the glyph cells,
which may make some fonts look squashed together.
The vfontas(1) tool may be used to convert an 8x16 font to a 9x16
font, IBM-style, for use with fbdev.


A1.fnt
	A font with a somewhat angular shape for the upper-case
	and digit glyphs.
	To be used with cp437AB.uni.
B1.fnt
	A font with more soft roundings in upper-case and digit glyphs.
	To be used with cp437AB.uni.
E1.fnt
	a Eurostile-inspired geometric, sans-serif font with serifs
	placed on a few select glyphs, reuses some dingbat glyphs from mu.
mu0.fnt
	sans-serif font
	mu.fnt from the SUSE "kbd" package

uefi.psf
	Font from EFI Development Kit; license is BSD-2-Clause-Patent,
	licensor is Intel. They seem to have derived this from
	AST (AST Research) PremiumExec 386 laptop.
	The font makes an appearance in some AST2x00 chips
	(ASPEED Technologies; unrelated to AST Research),
	and in the Getaway PC (https://youtu.be/8xcFhoYoFXE )

	The font is 19 pixels high, but is designed with a pixel aspect ratio
	of 1.0. (The regular IBM VGA 9x16 font has 0.74.)

	A 80x25 screenful occupies 640x475 pixels, close enough to 640x480.
	EFIDK also offers 100x31 (900x589) and 128x41 (1152x760), which make
	less sense because the next standard resolutions are XGA at 1024x768
	and XGA+ at 1152x864.
